	<h1>DES 117<br> Design Matters</h1>
	<h2>Fall 2016</h2>

	<p><strong>Overview:</strong> The objective of this project is to incorporate your html and css skills learned to create a 5 page website that explores a design related technology, skill or concept that peaks your interest. Think of your site as part of an online exhibit where a wide range of viewers could come to better understand a design/technological invention/innovation.</p>

	<p>Give your site an appropriate name and design the name into a page identity (logo, banner).</p>

	<p>You will use html and external css, coded by hand, to design with attention to the layout and typography and ability to maintain a design across many pages.</p>

	<h2>Content Requirements</h2>
	<p>The project should have five pages with a cohesive look and navigation across all pages. The five pages will follow a specific structure for content.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<strong>Index (Home) Page:</strong> This page will include an overview of the topic.
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>Past:</strong> This page will include an historical look at the topic. Include imagery and a timeline of technological developments, and some analysis of what drove those developments. Include links to sources.
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>Present:</strong> This page will look at the technology today. What is cutting edge right now, and how does that compare to where this technology has been in the past. What factors play into where we are today (cultural, aesthetic, manufacturing)? Include imagery, and sources.
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>Future:</strong> Imagine where this technology will be in the future&hellip; Five years out, ten years out, a hundred years out. What is essential about this technology to human existance? What technological breakthroughs might we need to get there. Include concept imagery and any sources.
		</li>

		<li>
			<strong>Links and Sources:</strong> Collect all the resources you used for each of the other pages on one page and annotate it. Note: Wikipedia can be a place to start, but it can't be one of your sources. Dig deeper.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Design Requirements</h2>
	<p><strong>Formal Design:</strong> Demonstrate strong understanding of formal design concepts such as hierarchy, layout, and color. Strong imagery, simple, clear typography.</p>

	<p><strong>Functional Design:</strong> Include clear and consistent navigation. Pages should be easy on the eyes. Aim for sophisticated simplicity.</p>

	<h2>Development Requirements</h2>
	<p>Correctly hand crafted HTML and CSS, properly marked up with strong semantics. Images properly formatted and sized appropriately for the web. All files organized and correctly linked within a main folder, with a sub folder for images.</p>

	<h2>Project Deliverables</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Three page research paper:</strong> One page of written content for each content area&hellip; past, present and future.</li>

		<li><strong>Content Images:</strong> At least two appropriate images for each content area&hellip; past, present and future.</li>

		<li><strong>Three thumbnail sketches:</strong> Quick intitial ideas for how the site layout. Can be done on paper, and photographed or scanned for submission.</li>

		<li><strong>One set of wireframes:</strong> Digital file that clearly shows visual hierarchy, navigation and basic layout of the site.</li>

		<li><strong>One high fidelity mockup:</strong> Created in Photoshop or Illustrator, create fully designed images showing both the front page design and the internal page designs (if different).</li>

		<li><strong>One fully functional five page website:</strong> Hand coded, properly formed and linked html and css files.</li>

	</ol>
